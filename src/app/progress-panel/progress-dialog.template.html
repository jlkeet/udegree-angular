<h2 mat-dialog-title>Conjoint </h2>

<P>A conjoint programme allows you to work towards two bachelors degrees at the same time. You can obtain a joint qualification more quickly than if you completed each degree separately. Many conjoint programmes can be finished within four to five years, depending on the combination of degrees. A conjoint programme often requires just one extra course to be taken each year (on top of a normal full-time load). The short timeframe is due to a reduced points requirement per degree as some elective courses are not required. You can apply for a conjoint programme when you make your initial application or do so in subsequent years if you later decide youâ€™d like to gain a second degree. Not all degree programmes include conjoint options.</P>
